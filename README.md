Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Akshita Swarnkar
========================================================================================================================================



I'm a professional student in the art of procrastination, and a self-proclaimed coder when Netflix isn't calling 😎👩‍💻
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Four years of wrangling HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and here I am, the Leonardo da Vinci of creating virtual hamster wheels—lots of spinning, but no real direction. My websites have more interactivity than my social life, and I'm beginning to suspect my laptop is my only true fan 👩🏽‍💻



* 🌍  I'm based in : - I'm coding away in India, where my keyboard's spicy curry of code is turning bugs into flavorful features!
  
* 🖥️  See my portfolio at [: - Gigglefolio](http://portfolio-website-2022-five.vercel.app/)
  
* ✉️  You can contact me at [:- akshitawhitehat.code@gmail.com](mailto::- akshitawhitehat.code@gmail.com)
  
* 🚀  I'm currently working on [perfecting the art of staring at blank screens—a true masterpiece of nothingness in the making!](http://github.com/Shanvie)
  
* 🧠  I'm learning :- I'm currently juggling Python and JavaScript like a circus performer with two too many balls—watch out for the code collisions and syntax acrobatics! 🎪🐍💥🤹‍♀️
  
* 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on :- Looking for collaboration partners who can keep up—must be fluent in code, sarcasm, and have a PhD in dealing with my occasionally genius-level stupidity. Bonus points if you can explain complex concepts using only emojis. Apply within, but please leave your seriousness at the door! 😄🤖🤪
  
* ⚡  Attention, world! If you're brave enough to tag along on this coding escapade with a tomboy who considers debugging a form of extreme sport and treats coffee stains as her latest fashion trend, then brace yourself. I've got the finesse of a bull in a china shop, and my ability to break things is unmatched—seriously, I once crashed a calculator app. But hey, if you're up for a wild ride filled with laughter, confusion, and a touch of 'What on earth is she doing now?', then let's team up and see if we can build something awesome... while praying it doesn't implode. 🎢☕️🤷‍♀️ #TechTomboyOnTheLoose
